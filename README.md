This repository contains my notes on coding. Specifically on GO lang. Stuff I learned during Tomorrow School AI Piscine

I uploaded the folder with code to google drive at work email. So now set things up I only need to save it and then
```bash
git config --global credential.helper store
git config --global user.email "aigerabae@gmail.com"
git clone https://01.tomorrow-school.ai/git/aserikzha/piscinego.git
